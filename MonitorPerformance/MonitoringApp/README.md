## Monitor time and memory resource usage 

Manipulating garbage collection is an advanced technique that should not be used in application code. Garbage collector understands memory usage better than a programmer would. This scenario is for benchmarking example purpose.

Sample output:
```
Processing please wait...
2,756,608 physical bytes used.
5,210,112 virtual bytes used.
00:00:08.0066348 time span elapsed.
8,006 total milliseconds elapsed.
